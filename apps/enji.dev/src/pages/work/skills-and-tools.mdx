Over the years, I’ve honed my craft through a combination of experience and curiosity. Here’s a breakdown of the technologies that power my projects:

## Frontend Mastery

I’m all about creating clean, responsive, and interactive interfaces. These are the core technologies I use to bring designs to life:

- **Next.js**: My go-to framework for fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web apps.
- **React**: The foundation of modern web development, allowing me to build dynamic UIs with ease.
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile app development with a focus on beautiful, smooth animations.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: The backbone of web design, ensuring every site I build is responsive and looks great across devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The language that ties it all together, adding interactivity and functionality to every project.

## Backend & Database Knowledge

While Frontend is my main focus, having a strong understanding of Backend processes is key to building fully integrated applications:

- **Node.js**: For building server-side logic and APIs that work seamlessly with the Frontend.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: The framework that makes API development simple and efficient.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database for handling structured data and complex queries.
- **MongoDB**: My preferred NoSQL database for fast and scalable data storage.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching, sessions, and real-time applications.
- **Firebase**: Real-time databases and serverless architecture for quick, scalable solutions.

## Tools & Platforms

Every good developer needs the right tools to streamline their workflow. Here are the platforms and tools I trust to get the job done:

- **Git & GitHub**: Version control for tracking progress and collaborating on projects with ease.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My code editor of choice, packed with extensions to boost productivity.
- **Figma**: For collaborating on UI/UX design and turning wireframes into reality.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent and efficient development environments.
- **Postman**: Essential for API testing and ensuring smooth integration between Frontend and Backend.

## Always Learning, Always Improving

The world of tech moves fast, and so do I. I’m constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices to ensure the work I deliver is cutting-edge and future-proof.
